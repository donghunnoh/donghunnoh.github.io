        <div id="w-node-b915ad84-715b-fc9d-8156-ee63d52fd22b-0bc3e819" class="paragraph-light">In our innovative project, we have developed a dual-arm manipulator equipped with proprioceptive actuators and modular cooking cells. Unlike existing cooking robots that were limited to singular tasks, our system excels in multitasking, can cook a variety of dishes, and can autonomously carry out full cooking processes. The proprioceptive actuators of the dual-arm manipulator allows for dynamic movements, enabling the robot to move accurately but compliant enough to interact with the environment such as grasping motion, and to delicately manipulate dual-arm manipulation such as sweeping motion.<br>‍<br>We aimed to create a platform that would serve as a foundation for incorporating vision and more complex algorithms, and we believed that this foundational platform could demonstrate sufficiently reliable performance on its own. Built upon this mechanical intelligence and reliable hardware platform, we embrace the philosophy that software should be progressively upgraded to achieve the ultimate goal of creating a fully autonomous cooking robot. We have developed a fully autonomous cooking system prototype that operates reliably on its own by integrating the characteristics of proprioceptive actuators — backdrivability, force controllability, and fast joint speed — with a well-structured modular robotic kitchen.<br>‍<br>Refining the operation further, our dual-arm manipulator&#x27;s effectiveness extends beyond theory into applied practice. For instance, transportation tasks leverage an inverse dynamic controller validated through stringent performance testing, ensuring the manipulator adjusts to varying loads with unwavering precision. The integrated Tool Changing System, another feat of our design, negates the need for visual sensors by employing a mechanical tool changer coupled with an impedance controller, facilitating smooth interactions with the kitchen environment, even amidst unpredictable movements like managing a fryer basket.<br><br>In summary, the dual-arm manipulator equipped with proprioceptive actuators marks a significant stride in robotic cooking, adeptly managing and transporting culinary tools and ingredients with exceptional accuracy. This innovation paves the way for robots to undertake more intricate and delicate tasks within the kitchen, heralding a new era of robotics where machines complement human skill and creativity, enhancing collaboration in culinary arts.</div>
